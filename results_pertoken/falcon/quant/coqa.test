WARNING: You are currently loading Falcon using legacy code contained in the model repository. Falcon has now been fully ported into the Hugging Face transformers library. For the most up-to-date and high-performance version of the Falcon model code, please update to the latest version of transformers and then load the model without the trust_remote_code=True argument.

The argument `trust_remote_code` is to be used with Auto classes. It has no effect here and is ignored.
